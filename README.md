Some computer vision cases for practice.
1. MNIST (kaggle case, top-7%)
2. KTH video classification
3. Lipstics segmentation case (kaggle unranked case)
4. LFW (GAN of faces drawing)
5. eCommerce_tsum (parser of tsum cosmetic for men + look-alike recommendation for shave products from all other products relying on photo)
